# Linked Lists: Conceptual

## What is a linked list?

- Linked lists are one of the basic data structures used in comp sci

- The node at the beginning of a linked list is called the head node
- The node at the end of a linked list is called the tail node
- Common operations on a linked list: adding nodes, removing nodes, finding a node, traversing the linked list

### Adding to and Removing from the Linked List

- Adding a new node to the beginning of the list requires that you link the node to the current head node
- If you accidentally remove the single link to a node, that nodeâ€™s data and any following nodes could be lost to your application ("orphaned nodes")
