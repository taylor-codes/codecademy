# Why Data Structures and Algorithms

- Data structures and algorithms are at the backbone of every program
- Data structure are the way we are able to store and retrieve data
- Data structures handle 4 main functions:
    1. Inputting info
    1. Processing info
    1. Maintaining info
    1. Retrieving info
- Algorithms are instructions that the computer follows to carry out tasks
- Algorithms are used to manipulate and process data
- Data structures are useful in maintaining and storing data, but algorithms are what actually utilize that data
