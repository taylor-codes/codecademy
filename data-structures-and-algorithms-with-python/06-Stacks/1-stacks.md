# Stacks

## Stacks Intro

- Stacks contain data nodes
- Support 03 main operations:
    1. Push adds data to the top of the stack
    1. Pop removes and provides data from the top of the stack
    1. Peek reveals data on the top of the stack
- Implementations include a linked list or an array
- Can have a limited size
    - Pushing data onto a full stack results in a stack overflow
    - Poping data from an empty stack results in a stack underflow
- Stacks process data Last In, First Out
