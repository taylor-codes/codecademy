# Diving Deeper into Blockchain

## Gathering Blockchain Transactions

- Transactions - an exchange of value among participants on the blockchain network
- Participants - Individs. accessing the blockchain netowkr through computers to exchange value
- Unconfirmed - Blocks and transactions that are yet to be verified

## Adding More Blocks

- Concensus - process of agreeing to the transactions on the blockchain network

## How Hasing Maintains the Blockchain's Integrity

- Hasing - generating a random string of chars from a given input
- Immutable - something whose records cannot be changed

## Is Hashing Enough to Secure the Blockchain?

- Recalculating Hashes - replacing the incorrect hash with a "correct" one to validate the chain 

## Securing the Blockchain Further

- Proof-of-Work - security feat. in blockchain to prevent attackres from easily taking over the blockchain
- Trustless - feat. of the blockchain that states how the system doesn't rely on any participant to verify transactions

## Proof-of-Work

- Miners - special participants who calculate the Proof-of-Work to mine new blocks
- Nonce - number to be guessed by miners which when combined with the block produces an acceptable hash

## Diving Deeper into Proof-of-Work

- Longest Chain - the most trusted chain with the largest amount of computational work done in calculating the Proof-of-Work
