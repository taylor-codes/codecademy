# Thinking About Data

## Describing Categorical Variables

- Frequency - number of times a data value occurs
- Proportion - frequency divided by total occurences
- Percentage - proportion converted to decimal

## Describing Numeric Variables

- Distribution - a function that shows all possible values of a variable and how frequently each value occurs
- Noraml Distribution (aka, the bell curve)

## Mean and Standard Deviation

- Mean - describes the center of a numeric distribution by adding all values and dividing by the count; average
- Standard Deviation - describes the spread of values in a numeric distribution by measuring the average distance of the values from the mean

## Skewed Distributions

- Skewed distribution - asymmetrical with a steep change in frequency on one side and a flatter, trailing change in frequency on the other

## Median and IQR

- Median - the middle value when all values are arranged from smallest to largest
- Interquartile Range - The difference between Q3 and Q1

## Outliers and Robust Measures

- Outliers - extreme values that are distant from the rest of the distribution
    - tend to more heavily influence the mean than the median
- Robust statistics are often a better choice to measure the center and spread of a distribution that is skewed or has outliers

## Aggregate Data

- Mode - value with the highest frequency 
- Bimodal - Distribution with 2 modes

- Aggregation - summarizing a numeric variable across each value of a categorical variable

## Variable Relationships

- Correlation Coefficient - measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables; This number ranges from -1 to +1 and tells us two things about a linear relationship:
    - Direction: A positive coefficient means that higher values in one variable are associated with higher values in the other. A negative coefficient means higher values in one variable are associated with lower values of the other
    - Strength: The farther the coefficient is from 0, the stronger the relationship and the more the points in a scatter plot look like a line
