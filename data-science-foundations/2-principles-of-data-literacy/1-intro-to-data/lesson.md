# Case Studies in Data Literacy

Data Literacy is about how well we read, interpret, and communicate with data.

## Data Gaps

- "garbage in, garbage out" is a known phrase that means "our data-driven conclusions are only as stongs, robust, and well-supported as the data behind them."
- Part of understanding and communicating with data means asking the right questions so that we end up with useful, relevant data.
- Practicing good data literacy means asking...
    - Do we have sufficient data to answer the question at hand?
    - Can my data answer my exact question?
- Garbage data will make garbage predictions, no matter how good the model is.

## Addressing Bias

- Part of practicing good data literacy means asking‚Ä¶
    - Who particpiated in the data?
    - Who is left out?
    - Who made the data?

# Data Types and Quality

- There are 2 types of organization: methodology and shape
- Methodology - how the data is collected
- Shape - spreadsheet or table (most common); things we are measuring are in columns (variables) and indiv. instances (obersvations) are in rows

## The Shape of Data

- In a well-organized dataset, the variables describe a characteristic of our entities 

## Variable Types

- Numerical Values - variables that are measureed
- Categorical Values - varibales that are categorized

### Numerical variables

- Numerical valuea re a combo of measurment and unit
> Imagine I go into a cafe and ask the barista for 3. Three what? ‚òï? üç©? üíµ?

- Two ways to get a number: counting measuring measuring
- Counting gives you whole numbers and discrete vars
- Meausring gives you potenitially partial valuea and continuous vars

### Categorical Varibales

- Categorical varibales describe characteristics with with words or relative values
- Nominal Variable - think of a name, such as tree species (London Plane, Honeylocust, or Pin Oak)
- Dichotomous Variable - only have 2 logical positions (on/off, yes/no, true/false, 1/2)
- Ordinal Variable - Ranking; "on a scale of 1 to 5"

## Dealing with Messy Data

### What is a messy dataset?

## Working with Missing Data

- "Missing at Completely Random" - When there's no systemic reason why data is missing
- "Missing at Random" - When we can predict if one value is missing based on a value of another varible
- "Structurally Missing" - When we wouldn't expect a value to exist to begin with 

## Accuracy 

- Accuracy is a measure of how well records reflect reality.
- Standardization is essential for accuracy ‚Äì but it‚Äôs not the only way that accuracy can be compromised.

## Validity 

- Validity is making sure that our data actually measures what we think it is measuring
- The best way to spot issues with the validity of a dataset is to ask: Does this variable measure what I think it does?

## Representative Samples

- Convenience sampling - method adopted by researchers where they collect market research data from a conveniently available pool of respondents
- The goal of a sample is to represent a population. Any time a sample is made that does NOT reflect the entire population, it is a sampling error
